# Purple Shopping (OSMS) - Development Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the implementation phases for Purple Shopping, transitioning from the current foundation to a fully functional MVP within a 10-day development timeline.

### Dual Application Architecture
Purple Shopping consists of two integrated applications:
- **üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard** (`/dashboard/`) - Project listing and selection interface
- **üñ•Ô∏è Project Dashboard** (`/dashboard/[project-id]/`) - Project-specific management interface for business owners and staff  
- **üì± Mini-App** (`/app/`) - Customer-facing Telegram Web App for shopping and ordering

### Multi-Project Support ‚úÖ
**Enhanced Architecture for Scalability:**
- **Project Listing**: Central dashboard showing all user projects with roles
- **Dynamic Routes**: Project-specific dashboards via `/dashboard/[project-id]/` 
- **Clean Layout Separation**: Project listing has Purple Shopping header, project pages have streamlined sidebar
- **Role-Based Access**: Project-specific permissions and role management
- **Simplified Navigation**: Always-visible sidebar without toggle complexity
- **Type-Safe Components**: Required projectId parameters throughout navigation components

## Current Status: Phase 1.3 Complete ‚úÖ
**Foundation, Multi-Project Infrastructure, User Management & Item Management System** - All infrastructure, database schema, authentication, UI framework, clean multi-project architecture, comprehensive user management system, and complete item management system completed.

### Recent Updates: Bug Fixes & Optimizations ‚úÖ
- **Critical Filter Logic Bug Fixed**: Resolved issue where items weren't appearing due to incorrect filter application
- **Database Query Optimization**: Enhanced item retrieval with LEFT JOIN to include items without active price records
- **Type Safety Improvements**: Updated type definitions for better null handling and compatibility
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed debug code and unused imports for production readiness

  - Category-based item filtering in listings
  - Modal-based category creation from item forms

### 1.4 Data Access Layer ‚úÖ

#### **Server Actions Implementation**
- [x] **Data Access Layer Pattern (Next.js Security Best Practice):**
  - Follow pattern from: https://nextjs.org/blog/security-nextjs-server-components-actions
  - Create dedicated data access layer: `src/lib/data/` folder
  - Separate data fetching from server actions
  - Example structure: `src/lib/data/items.ts`, `src/lib/data/categories.ts`, `src/lib/data/projects.ts`
  - Data functions handle all database operations and security checks
  - **CRITICAL: Service Role Client Usage**: Use `createServiceRoleClient()` for all mutations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
  - **Security Pattern**: Always verify permissions with regular client BEFORE using service role client
- [x] **Server Actions as Thin Wrappers:**
  - Server actions in `src/lib/actions/` call data layer functions
  - Actions handle form validation and user input processing
  - Actions return user-friendly responses and handle redirects
  - Keep business logic in data layer, not in actions
- [x] **Type-safe Database Operations:**
  - Use TypeScript for full type safety with database types
  - Each data function returns typed results with proper error handling
  - Consistent return type: `Promise<{success: boolean, error?: string, data?: T}>`
- [x] **Error Handling Patterns:**
  - Data layer throws errors, actions catch and format them
  - Database constraint errors mapped to user-friendly messages
  - Authentication errors handled with proper redirects
  - Logging for debugging (console.error for now)
- [x] **Input Validation with Zod:**
  - Schema definitions in `src/lib/validations/` folder
  - Validate all server action inputs before calling data layer
  - Data layer assumes inputs are already validated
  - Client-side form validation using same schemas
  - Error messages returned for invalid inputs
- [x] **RLS Policy Compliance:**
  - Data layer handles all RLS policy compliance
  - Regular client (`createClient()`) for reads and permission checks
  - Service role client (`createServiceRoleClient()`) for mutations only
  - All queries automatically filtered by user's project access
  - Use `createClient()` for authenticated operations in data layer only
  - Server actions never directly access database
- [x] **Data Layer Security Pattern:**
  - Data functions verify user authentication and authorization
  - Check user project access before any database operation
  - Return appropriate errors for unauthorized access
  - Verify RLS policies work correctly in testing
  - **"server-only" imports required** for all data access layer files

#### **Client State Management**
- [x] **Zustand Stores for UI State:**
  - Create stores for: current project, user preferences, loading states
  - Item management state: selected items, filters, search query
  - Order management state: cart items, selected customer
  - Store structure: `src/lib/stores/` folder
- [x] **Optimistic Updates:**
  - Item creation: show item in list immediately, rollback on error
  - Stock updates: update UI immediately, sync with server
  - Order status changes: immediate feedback, server confirmation
- [x] **Error Boundary Implementation:**
  - Global error boundary for unhandled errors
  - Form-specific error boundaries for graceful failures
  - Toast notifications for user feedback
  - Error recovery options (retry, go back)

## Implementation Notes

### **Critical Development Guidelines** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **‚ùå NEVER use `npm run dev`** - Development server is strictly forbidden
- **‚úÖ Use `npm run build`** - For testing implementation and compilation validation
- **‚úÖ Use `npm run test`** - For automated testing and functionality validation
- **üîí Service Role Client Rule**: All database mutations MUST use `createServiceRoleClient()` 
- **üõ°Ô∏è Security First**: Always verify permissions with regular client BEFORE using service role
- **üìù "server-only" Required**: All data access layer files must import `"server-only"`

### **Database Operation Security Pattern** üîê
```typescript
import "server-only";
import { createClient, createServiceRoleClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server';

export async function mutateData(data: any) {
  const supabase = await createClient();        // For auth & permissions
  const supabaseAdmin = await createServiceRoleClient(); // For mutations only
  
  // 1. Authenticate
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  if (!user) throw new Error('Unauthorized');
  
  // 2. Verify permissions (using RLS-enabled client)
  const permissionCheck = await supabase.from('user_roles')...
  if (!hasPermission) throw new Error('Access denied');
  
  // 3. Perform mutation (using service role client)
  const result = await supabaseAdmin.from('table').insert(data);
  return result;
}
```

### Priority Order
1. **Items Management** (Core business entity)
2. **Orders & Customers** (Revenue generation)
3. **Dashboard Analytics** (Business insights)
4. **Telegram Integration** (Customer engagement)
5. **Polish & Deploy** (Presentation ready)

### Daily Goals
- **‚úÖ Phase 1.3 Complete**: Foundation, multi-project architecture, user management system, and complete item management system with image upload/display
- **Days 1-3**: Complete data operations, items working
- **Days 4-5**: Orders and customers functional
- **Days 6-7**: Dashboard showing real data and insights
- **Days 8-9**: Basic Telegram bot operational
- **Day 10**: Production-ready demonstration

### Quality Gates
- Each phase must be tested using `npm run build` (never `npm run dev`)
- Database operations must maintain data consistency
- All mutations must use service role client after permission verification
- UI must remain responsive and professional
- Security (RLS + service role pattern) must be verified at each step
- All data access layer functions must have "server-only" imports
