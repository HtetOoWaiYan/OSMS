## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Order Management Complexity**: Start with basic order creation, add advanced features incrementally
2. **Payment Integration**: Focus on manual payment tracking for MVP, integrate gateways later
3. **Performance Issues**: Implement caching early and monitor database query performance
4. **Telegram Integration**: Keep bot commands simple, focus on core functionality

### Contingency Plans

- **Order System**: Can use simplified order tracking if full system becomes complex
- **Payment Integration**: Manual payment confirmation is sufficient for MVP
- **Advanced Features**: Can be deferred to post-MVP releases
- **Performance**: Server-side caching and optimization can be enhanced incrementally
