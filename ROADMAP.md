# Purple Shopping (OSMS) - Development Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the implementation phases for Purple Shopping, transitioning from the current foundation to a fully functional MVP within a 10-day development timeline.

### Dual Application Architecture
Purple Shopping consists of two integrated applications:
- **üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard** (`/dashboard/`) - Shop management interface for business owners and staff
- **üì± Mini-App** (`/app/`) - Customer-facing Telegram Web App for shopping and ordering

## Current Status: Phase 0 Complete ‚úÖ
**Foundation & Architecture** - All infrastructure, database schema, authentication, and UI framework completed.

---

## Phase 1: Core Data Operations (Days 1-3)
**Priority: Get data flowing through the system**

### 1.1 Project Management & User Setup

#### **Project Creation Flow** 
**What we need from user:**
- [x] **Required Fields:**
  - Project name (shop/business name)
  - Telegram bot token (with guidance link)
  - Optional: Project description
- [x] **Implementation Details:**
  - New users with no project get onboarding flow
  - Onboarding guides through first project creation
  - Project creation form integrated into onboarding
  - Provide clear instructions: "How to create a Telegram Bot" link
  - Link to BotFather guide: https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial
  - **Important**: Guide user through BotFather process:
    1. Start chat with @BotFather
    2. Send `/newbot` command
    3. Choose bot name and username
    4. Copy the bot token (format: `123456789:AAEhBOweik6ad...`)
    5. Paste token into our form
- [x] **Technical Tasks:**
  - Create onboarding flow for new users (no project exists)
  - Multi-step onboarding: Welcome ‚Üí Bot Setup Guide ‚Üí Project Creation
  - Create server action: `createProject(name, botToken, description?)`
  - Check if user already has a project (redirect to dashboard if exists)
  - Auto-assign creator as admin role in `user_roles` table
  - Validate bot token format (should start with number:string)
  - Store project in `projects` table with `telegram_bot_token`
  - Redirect to dashboard after successful project creation
  - Block creation of additional projects in UI

#### **Project Settings Management** ‚úÖ
- [x] **Settings Page Implementation:**
  - Complete settings page at `/dashboard/settings`
  - Accessible via user profile dropdown in sidebar footer
  - Project information form with validation and error handling
  - Bot token display with masking and visibility toggle
- [x] **Project Update Functionality:**
  - Server action for updating project name, description, and bot token
  - Admin-only access control with proper permission checking
  - Service role client usage for secure database mutations
  - Data access layer following Next.js security best practices
- [x] **UI Components:**
  - Professional settings form with real-time validation
  - Masked bot token display with show/hide toggle
  - Project details panel showing creation and update timestamps
  - Success/error feedback with user-friendly messages

#### **Project Selection**
- [x] **Single Project Only (MVP Constraint):**
  - Limit to one project per user in UI
  - No project switching interface needed
  - Users with existing project go directly to dashboard
- [x] **New User Onboarding:**
  - Check if user has project on login/dashboard access
  - If no project: redirect to onboarding flow
  - If project exists: direct to dashboard
  - Onboarding includes: Welcome ‚Üí Bot Setup Guide ‚Üí Project Creation
- [x] **Post-Creation Flow:**
  - After successful project creation ‚Üí redirect to dashboard
  - Dashboard shows proper project data and navigation
  - No option to create additional projects in UI
- [ ] **Future Enhancement (Post-MVP):**
  - Multi-project support can be added later
  - Database already supports multiple projects per user
  - UI just needs to enforce single project limitation

#### **Default Admin Role Assignment**
- [ ] **Auto-assignment Logic:**
  - Project creator automatically gets 'admin' role
  - Insert into `user_roles` table: `(user_id, project_id, role: 'admin', is_active: true)`
  - Admin can invite others later as 'agent' or 'admin'

#### **User Role Management**
- [ ] **Team Member Invitation (Phase 1 - Simple):**
  - Add team member by email input
  - Send invitation email via Supabase Auth
  - Auto-assign 'agent' role to invited users
  - Basic user list with role display
- [ ] **Role-based Permission Checks:**
  - Implement permission helper: `checkUserPermission(userId, projectId, action)`
  - Admin can: manage items, orders, users, project settings
  - Agent can: manage items, orders (no user management)
  - Use in server actions and UI components
- [ ] **User Management Interface:**
  - Simple table: User email, Role, Status, Actions
  - Admin can: remove users, change roles (admin ‚Üî agent)
  - Show current user's role in header
  - Basic user search/filter by role

### 1.2 Item Management System

#### **CRUD Operations for Items**
**Core Item Data Required:**
- [ ] **Essential Fields:**
  - Item name (required)
  - Description (optional, textarea)
  - Price (current selling price)
  - Stock quantity (integer, default 0)
  - Category selection (dropdown from categories)
- [ ] **Optional Fields for MVP:**
  - SKU (auto-generate if empty: PROJ-001, PROJ-002...)
  - Weight (for shipping, optional)
  - Tags (array of strings, for search)
  - Min stock level (for low stock alerts)
- [ ] **Implementation Tasks:**
  - Create item form with validation (Zod schema)
  - Server action: `createItem()`, `updateItem()`, `deleteItem()`
  - Item list page with search and filters
  - Item detail/edit page
  - Soft delete (set `is_active: false` instead of hard delete)

#### **Upload and Manage Product Images**
- [ ] **Image Upload System:**
  - Use Supabase Storage for images
  - Multiple images per item (stored in `item_images` table)
  - Image upload component with drag-drop
  - Image preview and delete functionality
- [ ] **Image Management:**
  - Set primary image (first image as default)
  - Reorder images (drag and drop)
  - Image optimization (resize on upload)
  - Display images in item cards and detail views

#### **Inventory Management**
- [ ] **Stock Quantity Tracking:**
  - Current stock display in item list
  - Stock adjustment form (manual +/- adjustments)
  - Auto-deduct stock on order confirmation
  - Stock movement logging in `stock_movements` table
- [ ] **Low Stock Alerts:**
  - Dashboard indicator for items below min_stock_level
  - Low stock items list/badge
  - Email alerts (future enhancement)

#### **Category Management**
- [ ] **Simple Category System:**
  - Category name and description
  - One level only (no hierarchy for MVP)
  - CRUD operations: create, edit, delete categories
  - Assign items to categories
  - Category-based item filtering

### 1.3 Data Access Layer

#### **Server Actions Implementation**
- [x] **Data Access Layer Pattern (Next.js Security Best Practice):**
  - Follow pattern from: https://nextjs.org/blog/security-nextjs-server-components-actions
  - Create dedicated data access layer: `src/lib/data/` folder
  - Separate data fetching from server actions
  - Example structure: `src/lib/data/items.ts`, `src/lib/data/categories.ts`, `src/lib/data/projects.ts`
  - Data functions handle all database operations and security checks
  - **CRITICAL: Service Role Client Usage**: Use `createServiceRoleClient()` for all mutations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
  - **Security Pattern**: Always verify permissions with regular client BEFORE using service role client
- [x] **Server Actions as Thin Wrappers:**
  - Server actions in `src/lib/actions/` call data layer functions
  - Actions handle form validation and user input processing
  - Actions return user-friendly responses and handle redirects
  - Keep business logic in data layer, not in actions
- [x] **Type-safe Database Operations:**
  - Use TypeScript for full type safety with database types
  - Each data function returns typed results with proper error handling
  - Consistent return type: `Promise<{success: boolean, error?: string, data?: T}>`
- [x] **Error Handling Patterns:**
  - Data layer throws errors, actions catch and format them
  - Database constraint errors mapped to user-friendly messages
  - Authentication errors handled with proper redirects
  - Logging for debugging (console.error for now)
- [x] **Input Validation with Zod:**
  - Schema definitions in `src/lib/validations/` folder
  - Validate all server action inputs before calling data layer
  - Data layer assumes inputs are already validated
  - Client-side form validation using same schemas
  - Error messages returned for invalid inputs
- [x] **RLS Policy Compliance:**
  - Data layer handles all RLS policy compliance
  - Regular client (`createClient()`) for reads and permission checks
  - Service role client (`createServiceRoleClient()`) for mutations only
  - All queries automatically filtered by user's project access
  - Use `createClient()` for authenticated operations in data layer only
  - Server actions never directly access database
- [x] **Data Layer Security Pattern:**
  - Data functions verify user authentication and authorization
  - Check user project access before any database operation
  - Return appropriate errors for unauthorized access
  - Verify RLS policies work correctly in testing
  - **"server-only" imports required** for all data access layer files

#### **Client State Management**
- [ ] **Zustand Stores for UI State:**
  - Create stores for: current project, user preferences, loading states
  - Item management state: selected items, filters, search query
  - Order management state: cart items, selected customer
  - Store structure: `src/lib/stores/` folder
- [ ] **Optimistic Updates:**
  - Item creation: show item in list immediately, rollback on error
  - Stock updates: update UI immediately, sync with server
  - Order status changes: immediate feedback, server confirmation
- [ ] **Error Boundary Implementation:**
  - Global error boundary for unhandled errors
  - Form-specific error boundaries for graceful failures
  - Toast notifications for user feedback
  - Error recovery options (retry, go back)

## Implementation Notes

### **Critical Development Guidelines** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **‚ùå NEVER use `npm run dev`** - Development server is strictly forbidden
- **‚úÖ Use `npm run build`** - For testing implementation and compilation validation
- **‚úÖ Use `npm run test`** - For automated testing and functionality validation
- **üîí Service Role Client Rule**: All database mutations MUST use `createServiceRoleClient()` 
- **üõ°Ô∏è Security First**: Always verify permissions with regular client BEFORE using service role
- **üìù "server-only" Required**: All data access layer files must import `"server-only"`

### **Database Operation Security Pattern** üîê
```typescript
import "server-only";
import { createClient, createServiceRoleClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server';

export async function mutateData(data: any) {
  const supabase = await createClient();        // For auth & permissions
  const supabaseAdmin = await createServiceRoleClient(); // For mutations only
  
  // 1. Authenticate
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  if (!user) throw new Error('Unauthorized');
  
  // 2. Verify permissions (using RLS-enabled client)
  const permissionCheck = await supabase.from('user_roles')...
  if (!hasPermission) throw new Error('Access denied');
  
  // 3. Perform mutation (using service role client)
  const result = await supabaseAdmin.from('table').insert(data);
  return result;
}
```

### Priority Order
1. **Items Management** (Core business entity)
2. **Orders & Customers** (Revenue generation)
3. **Dashboard Analytics** (Business insights)
4. **Telegram Integration** (Customer engagement)
5. **Polish & Deploy** (Presentation ready)

### Daily Goals
- **Days 1-3**: Complete data operations, items working
- **Days 4-5**: Orders and customers functional
- **Days 6-7**: Dashboard showing real data and insights
- **Days 8-9**: Basic Telegram bot operational
- **Day 10**: Production-ready demonstration

### Quality Gates
- Each phase must be tested using `npm run build` (never `npm run dev`)
- Database operations must maintain data consistency
- All mutations must use service role client after permission verification
- UI must remain responsive and professional
- Security (RLS + service role pattern) must be verified at each step
- All data access layer functions must have "server-only" imports
