## [Unreleased]

### Added
#### Clean Architecture Improvements ✅

  - Deleted unused PageHeader component (no longer used after layout restructuring)
  - Cleaned up imports and dependencies throughout the codebase
  - Made projectId required parameter in AppSidebar and NavUser components
  - Removed conditional logic for projectId since it's always available in project context
- **Type Safety Improvements**: Enhanced component interfaces for better reliability
  - Required projectId in sidebar and navigation components eliminates edge cases
  - Simplified URL generation without conditional project ID checks
  - More predictable component behavior in project-specific contexts

#### Multi-Project Architecture (Phase 1.1+) ✅
- **Dynamic Project Routes**: Restructured dashboard from `/dashboard` to `/dashboard/[project-id]/`
  - Project listing page at `/dashboard` showing all user's projects with roles
  - Dynamic project-specific dashboard routes with project context
  - Project switching capability via "Switch Project" link in sidebar
  - Each project has its own isolated management interface
- **Enhanced Data Access Layer**: Multi-project support throughout the application
  - `getUserProjects()` function to fetch all projects for a user
  - Updated project creation to support multiple projects per user
  - Removed single-project MVP constraint for scalable architecture
  - Enhanced permissions checking with project-specific access control
- **Project-Aware Navigation**: Updated UI components for multi-project support
  - Sidebar displays current project name and "Switch Project" functionality
  - Project-specific navigation URLs (e.g., `/dashboard/[id]/items`, `/dashboard/[id]/settings`)
  - User profile dropdown with project-specific settings links
  - Enhanced project listing with role badges and creation/update timestamps

#### Project Management & User Setup (Phase 1.1) ✅
- **Project Creation Flow**: Complete onboarding system for new users
  - Multi-step onboarding: Welcome → Bot Setup Guide → Project Creation
  - Telegram Bot setup guidance with @BotFather integration
  - Project creation form with validation and error handling
  - Automatic admin role assignment for project creators
- **Project Settings Management**: Complete settings interface ✅
  - Settings page at `/dashboard/[project-id]/settings` accessible via user profile dropdown

- **Data Access Layer**: Following Next.js security best practices ✅
  - Comprehensive project data access functions
  - **Service Role Client Pattern**: All mutations use `createServiceRoleClient()` after permission checks
  - **Regular Client Pattern**: All reads and permission checks use `createClient()` with RLS
  - User role management and permission checking
  - RLS policy compliance and multi-tenant security
  - Type-safe database operations with proper error handling
  - **"server-only" imports**: All data access layer files protected from client-side access
- **Server Actions**: Thin wrapper pattern for form handling ✅
  - Project creation action with Zod validation and dynamic project redirection
  - Project update action with proper authentication and authorization
  - User project status checking with multi-project awareness
  - Proper error handling and user feedback
- **UI Components**: Professional onboarding and multi-project experience ✅
  - Welcome page with feature overview
  - Step-by-step Telegram bot creation guide
  - Project creation form with bot token validation

#### Technical Implementation ✅
- **Route Architecture**: Next.js 15 dynamic routes with proper param handling
  - Async params support for Next.js 15 compatibility
  - Type-safe route parameters with Promise-based param access
  - Project-specific layouts with authentication and authorization
- **Validation Schemas**: Zod schemas for project creation and bot token validation
- **Updated Navigation**: Project-aware navigation with dynamic URLs
- **Database Integration**: Enhanced integration with projects and user_roles tables
- **Security Enhancements**: Service role client implementation for secure mutations
- **Development Guidelines**: Critical security patterns and build-only testing requirements

#### Development Environment & Security ✅
- **Critical Development Guidelines**: 
  - ❌ `npm run dev` strictly forbidden for security
  - ✅ `npm run build` for implementation testing and validation
  - ✅ `npm run test` for automated functionality testing
- **Database Security Pattern**: 
  - Service role client for all mutations after permission verification
  - Regular client for reads and authentication checks
  - Explicit "server-only" imports for all data access layer files
- **Build-Only Testing**: Production-like testing without development server exposure

### Planned
- Item management CRUD operations (Phase 1.2)
- Order processing workflow (Phase 2)
- Customer management system (Phase 2)
- Dashboard analytics and reporting (Phase 3)
- Telegram bot integration (Phase 4)
- Mini-app development (Phase 4)

### Fixed ✅
- **Project Update Error**: Fixed PGRST116 error when updating project information
  - Root cause: RLS policies preventing mutations with regular client
  - Solution: Use service role client for mutations after permission verification
  - Security maintained: Permission checks still performed with regular client + RLS
- **Form Input Conflicts**: Resolved duplicate input names in settings form
- **Bot Token Display**: Implemented secure masking with optional visibility toggle
