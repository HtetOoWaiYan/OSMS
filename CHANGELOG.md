  - **Regular Client Pattern**: All reads and permission checks use `createClient()` with RLS
  - User role management and permission checking
  - RLS policy compliance and multi-tenant security
  - Type-safe database operations with proper error handling
  - **"server-only" imports**: All data access layer files protected from client-side access
- **Server Actions**: Thin wrapper pattern for form handling ✅
  - Project creation action with Zod validation

  - User project status checking
  - Proper error handling and user feedback
- **UI Components**: Professional onboarding and settings experience ✅

  - Project creation form with bot token validation
  - Settings form with masked token display and update functionality
  - Progress indicators and navigation between steps
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile

#### Technical Implementation ✅
- **Validation Schemas**: Zod schemas for project creation and bot token validation
- **Badge Component**: Added missing UI component for step indicators
- **Updated Navigation**: Settings accessible via user profile dropdown (not main sidebar)
- **Database Integration**: Full integration with projects and user_roles tables
- **Security Enhancements**: Service role client implementation for secure mutations
- **Development Guidelines**: Critical security patterns and build-only testing requirements

#### Development Environment & Security ✅
- **Critical Development Guidelines**: 
  - ❌ `npm run dev` strictly forbidden for security
  - ✅ `npm run build` for implementation testing and validation
  - ✅ `npm run test` for automated functionality testing
- **Database Security Pattern**: 
  - Service role client for all mutations after permission verification
  - Regular client for reads and authentication checks
  - Explicit "server-only" imports for all data access layer files
- **Build-Only Testing**: Production-like testing without development server exposure

### Planned
- Item management CRUD operations (Phase 1.2)
- Order processing workflow (Phase 2)
- Customer management system (Phase 2)
- Dashboard analytics and reporting (Phase 3)
- Telegram bot integration (Phase 4)
- Mini-app development (Phase 4)

### Fixed ✅
- **Project Update Error**: Fixed PGRST116 error when updating project information
  - Root cause: RLS policies preventing mutations with regular client
  - Solution: Use service role client for mutations after permission verification
  - Security maintained: Permission checks still performed with regular client + RLS
- **Form Input Conflicts**: Resolved duplicate input names in settings form
- **Bot Token Display**: Implemented secure masking with optional visibility toggle
